# CIFAR-100_Image_Classification
This repository contains a Python script for image classification using pre-trained deep learning models VGG16 and ResNet50.This repository contains a Python script for image classification using pre-trained deep learning models VGG16 and ResNet50. The models are trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset, which consists of 100 classes of images. The script loads and preprocesses the data, visualizes sample images, and trains both VGG16 and ResNet50 models. After training, the script evaluates their accuracy on the test set and selects the best-performing model for classification. The project aims to demonstrate the use of transfer learning for image recognition tasks and provides visualization of training and validation accuracy and loss. Use this repository as a starting point for your own image classification projects or for further research in the field of computer vision.
